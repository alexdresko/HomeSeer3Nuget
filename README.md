# HomeSeer3Nuget
Unofficial nuget package containing HomeSeer 3 assemblies required for HomeSeer 3 plugin development

This package was created by Alex Dresko with no permission from HS. HS is deprecating HS3 and this repo reflects those changes. 

The nuget package will continue to work for HS3 development, but it may not be updated again once HS4 is released. Please submit a PR if you would like to udpate the nuget package.
